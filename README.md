## AEB Processing
AEB tests are processed using a program called DIAdem, it is distributed by National Instruments. All of the DIAdem scripts and dialogs that are used to collect and process data are located under the Processing directory of this repository.
IIHS uses the Oxford RT to collect the data needed to evaluate AEB systems. If you're using this system as well, most of the modifications needed to run these scripts will be related to modifying paths because the channel naming conventions should be the same from RT to RT.
To begin, run the AEBStartup.VBS script.
